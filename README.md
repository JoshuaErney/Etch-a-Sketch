# Project - Etch-a-Sketch Game

Building the old time game known as "Etch-a-Sketch".

## Getting Started

### Instructions

- [x] Create a div container (HTML file)
- [x] Use Flexbox for ordering the divs (bon't use border or margin styling)
- [ ] Add a hover effect (change color) for all 256 divs
- [x] Create button that asks for number of squares per side (user input max = 100)
  - [x] a popup screen/box will appear
  - [x] the old grid will be removed
  - [x] the new grid will be added.
  - [x] Research button tags that can be used in conjuntion with JS Functions

#### Goal

Create a functional, web-based drawing application that mimics the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy. Users should be able to create/adjust the grid size dynamically. They then will be able to "draw" on the grid by hovering their mouse over the squares. Additionally, users have the ability to clear the grid and change the color of the squares, when hovered over, by selecting a different color option.

## Acknowledgments

1. I initially faced challenges in implementing Flexbox for this project, particularly with ensuring that the boxes stretched properly in the last row. After several attempts, I decided to seek out additional resources and came across a tutorial by "Self Taught Dev" on YouTube. The video demonstrated an effective approach using both column and row layouts with Flexbox to achieve a functional grid, which greatly assisted in resolving the issues I encountered.
